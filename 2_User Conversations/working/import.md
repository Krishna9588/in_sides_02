# **Insights – Founder Intelligence System (v1)**

### **Agent Architecture Requirement Document**

---

# **1. Objective**

Build a system of AI agents that replaces the work of:

- a product research intern
- a market research analyst
- a founder’s ops assistant

The system should help answer:

“What are the most important user problems in retail investing, and what should we build next?”

---

# **2. Scope (What to Build)**

The system should consist of **5 core agents** working in a pipeline:

1. Research Ingestion Agent
2. Insight Extraction Agent
3. Research Synthesis Agent
4. Product Brief Agent
5. Founder Copilot (Query Interface)

This is a **closed-loop system**:

**Data → Insights → Hypotheses → Product Ideas → Founder Decisions**

---

# **3. Core Principles**

The system must follow these principles:

### **1. Structured Outputs Over Summaries**

All outputs must follow predefined formats (schemas).

No free-form summaries.

---

### **2. Signal Over Noise**

The system should filter and prioritize **high-signal inputs only**.

---

### **3. Decision-Oriented**

Every output should help answer:

“What should we build?”

---

### **4. Simplicity First**

Build a working v1. Avoid over-engineering.

---

# **4. Agent Specifications**

**`My Though from the Meeting.`**

**`*Meet - 1` - Notes***

**`Problem Definition`**

- **Transcript Insights:** A system to read your raw transcripts and automatically find key patterns and insights.
- **Market Research:** Extracting competitor details like their tech, reviews, market presence, and financial profits.
- **News and SEBI Guidelines:** Automated scraping to constantly pull and analyze the latest relevant news and regulatory updates.
- **Dashboard:** A simple web interface with a chatbot so you can ask questions and get instant answers from all this compiled data.
- Script
    
    
    I need to be:
    
    - clearer
    - sharper
    - more executable
    
    What You Should NOT Do
    Be ruthless here:
    
    Don’t build full scraping infra
    Don’t try real-time pipelines
    Don’t add authentication, scaling, etc.
    Don’t over-design UI
    
    So when you speak, say things like:
    
    - “This replaces manual research time by X”
    - “This becomes a daily decision tool”
    - “This scales to multiple companies”

---

**`Things we need to work on`**

1. The Interface
2. Transcript (Audio, **Text**) insights (sales, product, investor calls).
3. Market and competitor research.
4. News, SEBI, and Gov guidelines tracking.
5. The Chatbot Experience

---

Any on of this features:

“Insight Confidence Score”- Show how reliable each insight is
“Timeline of events from news” - Don’t do all three.

**`System must feel like`**

- It **collects information automatically**
- It **organizes it**
- It **answers questions instantly**
- Show working flow
- Keep it simple but real
- Focus on use case clarity

---

- Initially prototype should do ONLY:
    
    `Very 1st` 
    
    Input: Give it -
    
    - A company name OR
    - A transcript
    
    Processing: Extract -
    
    - Key insights
    - Competitor mentions
    - Important signals
    
    Output:
    
    - Clean dashboard
    - Chatbot that answers:
        - “Summarize this”
        - “Who are competitors?”
        - “What are risks?

- Flow Should Look Like
    
    Step 1: Data Ingestion
    
    - Upload transcript OR Type company name
    
    Step 2: AI Processing
    
    - Use:
        - Gemini / LLM
        - Simple scraping (SerpAPI or mock data)
    
    Step 3: Structured Output
    
    - Insights
    - Competitors
    - News summary
    
    Step 4: Chat Interface
    
    - “Ask anything about this data”

- Architecture (Keep It Practical)
    
    Don’t over-engineer. Show something that can scale later.
    
    Backend
    
    - Python (FastAPI)
    - LangChain or simple LLM calls
    - Basic scraper (BeautifulSoup / API)
    
    Storage
    
    - MongoDB or even JSON (prototype is fine)
    
    Frontend
    
    - Simple React / Next.js OR even Streamlit

- **Architecture you should present**
    
    **3.1 Data ingestion layer**
    
    - **Transcripts**: Upload PDF/Doc/Zoom
    export → convert to text → segment by speaker and time.
    - **Competitors**: Crawler for:
        - Landing pages, pricing, product docs.
        - Play Store/App Store reviews.
    - **News & SEBI**:
        - Scheduled scrapers for:
            - Financial news tagged to their domain.
            - SEBI circulars/press releases relevant to fintech, LODR, PMS, fraud, compliance.
    
    Describe this as “Connectors” so later you can add RBI, MCA, etc.
    
    **3.2 Normalization & enrichment**
    
    - Clean + deduplicate.
    - Tag each document with metadata:
        - Type: transcript, competitor, news, SEBI.
        - Date, source, company, product, geography.
    - For transcripts: auto‑add:
        - “Call type” (sales, support, product).
        - Sentiment per speaker/segment.
        - Detected entities: product names, features, risk terms.
    
    **3.3 Indexing & retrieval (RAG core)**
    
    - Chunk text with structure (per section, per Q/A, per SEBI clause).
    - Store in vector DB + keyword index.
    - Implement **domain‑aware retrieval**:
        - If user asks “SEBI guidelines on X”, prefer SEBI data.
        - If “What are customers complaining about?”, prefer transcripts + reviews.
    - Show that this is similar to finance‑specific RAG systems like FinSage or RavenPack’s RAG, which combine multi‑modal preprocessing and domain‑special retrieval for financial documents.
    
    **3.4 Reasoning & chatbot layer**
    
    - LLM agent orchestrator:
        - Classifies query: “transcript insight”, “competitor”, “regulatory/news”, or “mixed”.
        - Calls appropriate tools:
            - Transcript analyzer.
            - Competitor summarizer.
            - Regulatory/news monitor.
        - Synthesizes answer with citations to actual paragraphs, SEBI sections, etc.
    
    Mention that future versions can add rule‑based checks for SEBI/RBI obligations (e.g., LODR Reg. 30 disclosures, AML/KYC patterns, etc.)

**`*Meet - 2` - Notes***

Transcripts

Input: Audio, Text
From this. we need to build an logic to 
1. Extract the content → 2. Structure it first in proper formatting → 3. Extract relevant information from that → 4. Find Problems, decisions, improvements. → 5. Final conclusion of talk, What we should do next. ⇒ Anything useful for decision making.

⇒ And this should be stored in rag and later should be accessible from Chat box.

#### Market and competitor research

**Input**

{Company_1} or {company1, company2, ..} ; Domain

- Input
    
    
    | **Input Type** | **Data Field** | **Example / Description** |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | **Primary Target** | `Target_Sector` | e.g., "WealthTech: Fractional Real Estate Investment in India." |
    | **Competitor List** | `Competitor_Entities` | List of names or URLs (e.g., "PropShare," "hBits," "Strata"). |
    | **Specific Sources** | `Data_Source_Scope` | Web, SEBI Circulars, G2 Reviews, PlayStore, or LinkedIn Job Posts. |
    | **Search Parameters** | `Intelligence_KPIs` | "Tech Stack," "Revenue Growth," "Regulatory Penalties," "User Complaints." |
    | **Time Horizon** | `Analysis_Period` | e.g., "Last 2 quarters" or "Historical 3 years." |
    | **Regulatory Filter** | `Compliance_Framework` | e.g., "SEBI (Investment Advisers) Regulations, 2013." |

**Output**

First we need to ⇒ 1. Find domain, 2. Firmo, 3. Techno, 4. Revenue_details, 5. Higher Management Peoples.

- Output
    
    
    | **Output Component** | **Format** | **Industrial Value** |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | **Competitor Matrix** | `JSON / Table` | Side-by-side comparison of features, pricing, and tech stack. |
    | **Sentiment Analysis** | `Score (0-100)` | Aggregated "Health Score" based on recent news and user reviews. |
    | **Regulatory Risk Flag** | `Alert Levels` | Highlights if a competitor was recently fined or if new SEBI rules affect them. |
    | **Product Gap Analysis** | `Bullet Points` | "Competitor A has X, but users complain about Y. Build Z to win." |
    | **Financial Pulse** | `Estimates` | Funding status, valuation trends, and estimated burn rate from news. |
    | **Executive Summary** | `Markdown` | A 3-sentence "TL;DR" for quick decision-making. |
- Example Workflow (Industrial Scenario)
    
    **The Input:**
    
    > "Analyze **Jupiter** and **Fi** in the **Neobanking** sector. Focus on their **UPI plugin tech**, **recent SEBI/RBI compliance news**, and **user reviews** regarding customer support from the last **90 days**."
    > 
    
    **The Agent's Internal Logic (via LangChain + Gemini):**
    
    1. **Search:** Scrapes SEBI/RBI news portals for "Jupiter" and "Fi."
    2. **Scrape:** Pulls recent 1-star and 5-star reviews from PlayStore/AppStore.
    3. **Analyze:** Gemini reads the "Raw Transcripts" (per your notes) of their latest earnings calls or interviews.
    4. **Vectorize:** Stores the key findings in **Supabase pgvector** for future chat queries.
    
    **The Desired Output (Dashboard View):**
    
    - **Feature Gap:** "Jupiter has launched 'Community Labs'; Fi is still focused on 'Savings Rules'."
    - **Compliance Alert:** "RBI's new digital lending guidelines may require both to update their KYC workflow by Q3."
    - **Sentiment:** "Jupiter sentiment is down 12% due to recent app lag reports."

---

#### News, SEBI, and Gov guidelines tracking.

So we have a target section (Query) 

⇒ For that we need to scrape the latest news. 
⇒ We need to scrape Big Impact news in the past years. 

We need to figure out the government Policies and Regularization in that specific section and schemes working and operating in that feild.

- **The Fintech Regulatory Input & Output Table**
    
    
    | **Category** | **Proper Input (Sources)** | **Desired Output (Intelligence)** |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | **SEBI Circulars** | **Official RSS:** `sebi.gov.in/sebirss.xml`. Focus on "Investment Advisers" and "Research Analysts" sections. | **Impact Score:** A 1–10 rating of how this rule affects your specific business model. |
    | **RBI Notifications** | **RBI Notification Page:** Scrape `rbi.org.in` daily. Specifically track "Digital Lending" and "Payment Systems." | **Compliance Checklist:** A bulleted list of "Must-Do" actions for your engineering/legal team. |
    | **Niche News** | **The Ken / Medianama / Entrackr:** High-signal sources that explain *why* a policy changed. | **Competitor Response:** How other Fintechs (e.g., Razorpay, PhonePe) are reacting to the news. |
    | **Gov Guidelines** | **MeitY & Ministry of Finance:** Track the **DPDP Act (Data Privacy)** and GST council updates. | **Strategic Summary:** A 3-sentence "TL;DR" for the CEO on whether to pivot or proceed. |
    | **Social Sentiment** | **Twitter (X) / LinkedIn:** Track keywords like "RBI Ban" or "SEBI Fine" + [Competitor Name]. | **Early Warning:** Detection of outages or regulatory "raids" before they hit mainstream news. |
- **Automating the "SEBI/RBI Pipeline"**
    
    Since you are using **Gemini Pro** and **LangChain**, you should build a two-stage pipeline for these documents:
    
    **Stage A: The "Watcher" (Low Cost)**
    
    - **Tool:** Use a simple Python script on **Hostinger/Railway** to monitor the SEBI RSS feed.
    - **Logic:** If a new title contains keywords (e.g., "KYC," "UPI," "Lending"), trigger the next stage.
    
    **Stage B: The "Analyzer" (High Power)**
    
    - **Tool:** Send the PDF/URL to **Gemini Pro**.
    - **Prompt:** *"You are a Senior Fintech Compliance Officer. Read this new SEBI circular and identify: 1. Deadline for compliance. 2. Specific technical changes required in our database. 3. Risk level for a wealth-tech startup."*
- **Industrial-Grade Fintech Sources (2026 List)**
    
    For your agent to be "expert-level," feed it these specific high-quality inputs:
    
    1. **ET BFSI (Fintech Section):** Best for industry-wide shifts and executive movements.
    2. **Finshots (Policy):** Excellent for understanding complex financial jargon in "plain English" (perfect for pre-processing text for your LLM).
    3. **Medianama:** The "gold standard" for digital policy, privacy laws, and payment regulation in India.
    4. **RBI’s Master Directions:** Unlike "Notifications," these are living documents. Your agent should check the "Updated as of" date to ensure your Supabase data is current.
    5. **DigiSahamati (AA Ecosystem):** If your product uses Account Aggregators, tracking this site is mandatory for technical schemas.
- **Critical Technical Tip for Fintech Data**
    
    **The "Context Window" Advantage:** Regulatory documents are often 50+ pages long. Instead of "chunking" them into small pieces (traditional RAG), use **Gemini Pro’s 1M+ context window**. Feed the *entire* Master Direction into the prompt.
    
    **Why?** In Fintech, a footnote on page 42 can contradict a headline on page 1. Small "chunks" of data will miss this context; Gemini’s long-context will see it.
    
    **The "Invisible" Logic for your Dashboard:**
    In your **Supabase** schema, create a table called `regulatory_alerts`:
    
    - `source_url`: Link to SEBI/RBI.
    - `raw_text_summary`: Gemini-generated TL;DR.
    - `action_required`: Boolean (True/False).
    - `affected_module`: (e.g., "KYC Module," "Payment Gateway").
    
    Does this give you a clear enough roadmap for the "News & SEBI" part of your dashboard? Or should we look into the specific **Python libraries** for PDF scraping of government sites?
